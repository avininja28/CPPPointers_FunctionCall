Declare a function with 2 pointer parameters

In main function, declare 2 integer variables and accept values for them.

Display the integers before swapping.

Call the function with values of the integers.(Eg: &a,&b)

Define the function, by using a third pointer variable and assigning it the first integer memory. Assign the second integer memory to the first. Assign the third pointer value to the second pointer variable.
